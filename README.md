This repository contains solutions to three different problems, each implemented in a different language. The problems involve SQL, Python, and Java.

## Files

1. **SQL-Query.sql**: This file contains a SQL query for listing colleges with students ranked between 1 and 3 for the year 2015.

2. **TransformDateFormats.py**: This Python file includes a function `transform_date_format` that converts dates from multiple formats into a standardized format (YYYYMMDD).

3. **isValidParentheses.java**: This Java file includes a function `isValid` that checks if a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']' is valid.
